### **Description:**
Crystal collector is a game where users are given a random number or score to match each round. Players have four different crystals, each assigned a random hidden value each round.Players must then click on the crystals which increments their total score for that crystals value. Player wins by matching the randomly generated number, but loses if they "bust" or go over the random score to match. If players "bust", gameplay is reset, new values are assigned and the game restarts.<br>
